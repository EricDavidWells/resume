I am a Master's graduate in Mechanical Engineering (focus on prosthetics development) with a diverse
skillset built around my passion, robotics. My engineering skills are strengthened by software and hardware
capabilities gained in academic and industry settings, as well as through many self-directed projects. I am looking
forward to starting a career where I can apply my knowledge and skills to society's betterment.
